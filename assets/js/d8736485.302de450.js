Some days me and some other nerds would spend 20 hours straight studying the most minor thing: like is there a correlation between better lighting at the start of the video and less viewer drop off (there is, have good lighting at the start of the video haha) or other tiny things like that. And the result of those probably 20,000 to 30,000 hours of studying is I\u2019d say I have a good grasp on what makes Youtube videos do well. The three metrics you guys need to care about is Click Thru Rate (CTR), Average View Duration (AVD), and Average View Percentage (AVP). Make sure you know those abbreviations because that's how most people will refer to them. Up first we\u2019ll talk about CTR. This is important no matter what department you work in. CTR is basically how many people see our thumbnail in their feeds divided by how many that click it. If 100,000,000 people see our thumbnail and 10,000,000 click on it then that means 10% clicked and we have a 10% ctr. This is what dictates what we do for videos. \u201cI Spent 50 Hours In My Front Yard\u201d is lame and you wouldn\u2019t click it. But you would hypothetically click \u201cI Spent 50 Hours In Ketchup\u201d. Both are relatively similar in time/effort but the ketchup one is easily 100x more viral. An image of someone sitting in ketchup in a bathtub is exponentially more interesting than someone sitting in their front yard. Titles are equally as important for getting someone to click. A simple way to up that CTR even more would be to title it \u201cI Survived\u201d instead of \u201cI Spent\u201d. That would add more intrigue and make it feel more extreme. In general the more extreme the better. \u201cI Don\u2019t Like Bananas\u201d won\u2019t perform the same as \u201cBananas Are The Worst Food On Earth\u201d. Now if you\u2019re in production or creative you might be wondering, why does the title and thumbnail matter to me? Expectations is why. The title and thumbnail on the videos you will be producing set the expectations for the viewer for your video. Imagine you clicked on a video titled \u201cWorld\u2019s Largest Bouncy Castle\u201d and the thumbnail had a giant yellow bouncy castle beside a bunch of huge buildings. Then when the video plays it's not a yellow bouncy castle, it's red. It\u2019s also not the world\u2019s largest. It\u2019s also in a field with no buildings like the thumbnail. You\u2019d feel like you were lied to and click off because the video did not meet the expectations of the title/thumbnail. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST KNOW THE TITLE AND THUMBNAILS OF THE VIDEOS YOU ARE MAKING! How can you know how to   start your video if you don\u2019t even know what expectations the viewers have of you?"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Now let's jump over to the second metric that matters. AVD. This is how long on average people watch a given video. The cool thing about Youtube is they give us super detailed graphs for every video that show the exact second we lose a viewer on every single video."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"img",src:n(17408).A+"",width:"930",height:"848"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"See that blue line in the image above? That represents the attention span of the 60 million people that clicked on this video. It\u2019s crazy but we can see exactly when every single person who clicked on this video clicks off. As with almost every video on Youtube, the first minute has the most loss (go look). This is why we freak out so much about the first minute and go so above and beyond to   make it the best we freakin can. On this particular video we lost 21 million viewers in the first minute of the video (which surprisingly compared to other channels is above average) and could have been much worse. Let\u2019s say the start of the video wasn\u2019t well-lit, I didn\u2019t match the expectations of the clickbait, I didn\u2019t pre plan what I\u2019d say, and we didn\u2019t front load some interesting stuff for the first minute of content, we would have lost much less then 21 million people. Because it wouldn\u2019t have even got 21 million views lol. But if the views were hypothetically fixed then instead of still having 39 million viewers at the 1 minute mark it would be more like 20 million viewers. The first minute of each video is the most important minute of each video."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"After the first minute of content you will have what we call minutes 1 thru 3. This is where you have to transition from hype to execution (generally). Stop telling people what they will be watching and start showing them. An example of a 1 thru 3 minute tactic we would use is crazy progression. Let\u2019s say we have 10 minute video about a guy surviving weeks in the woods. Instead of making the first 3 minutes of the video about his first day then progressing from there like a logical filmmaker would. We\u2019d tried to cover multiple days in the first 3 minutes of the video so the viewer is now super invested in the story. They\u2019ve seen this man survive multiple days in the woods and emotionally now want to see how much further he can go. We also want to do something around the 3 minute mark called a 3 minute re-engagement. A re-engagement can be described as content that is highly interested that fits the story and makes people genuinely impressed. Another way to look at this is it\u2019s a segment that \u201conly MrBeast can do this\u201d. It\u2019s important to re-engage the viewer around this time because they could get bored of the story and click off. These re-engagements are usually spectacles and sometimes need lots of time and money to perfect. A good example of a re-engagement is when Karl was put in charge of watching Josh in the \u201c$10,000 Every Day You Survive Prison\u201d video."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Following the first minute, then minutes 1 thru 3, is obviously what we call minute 3 through minute 6 and is the next most important part of the video. This is where you plan out all the most exciting and interesting content that is also very simple. This includes lots of quick scene changes and highly stimulating simple content that reflects the story. The goal is to make them fall in love with the story, the people in the video and the overall video itself. If we can get them to watch the first half of the video there\u2019s a very high chance they\u2019ll watch to the end. Usually at the 6 minute mark we will include another re-engagement that is highly interesting but needs a little more explanation and will push the story in the back half of the video."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And lastly, we have what we call back half content. I have to be careful writing this because I don\u2019t want you to ever for a second think I am okay with content being subpar. Many videos have been killed because the back half content was ass lol. But in general once you have someone for 6 minutes they are super invested in the story and probably in what I call a \u201clull\u201d. They are watching the video without even realizing they are watching a video. Typically the not as good content would be in the back half of the video. Don\u2019t ever signal the end of the video unless it\u2019s to build hype for the prize or payoff at the end of the video.

Whether it is production, creative, or editing you must always know what minute mark the content you are working on is. If you don\u2019t then you\u2019re not doing it right. I just whipped out a calculator and the combined seconds of content of our last 100 videos is 81,801 seconds. Which divided by 100 means the average mrbeast video is 818 seconds or 13 minutes and 37 seconds. Some are shorter (like when we do a real time shoot or something more emotional and don\u2019t want it dragged out) and some are longer (giant spectacles like giving away an island as an example) but 13 minutes is the average and you are expected to know when producing which minute of that 13 minutes you are working on."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And since we\u2019re on the topic of retention graphs here is a cool visual."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{alt:"img",src:n(82024).A+"",width:"1228",height:"1588"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"The last of the 3 trackable metrics that matters to virality is AVP and tbh this doesn\u2019t matter as much to you.

An example of the \u201cwow factor\u201d would be our 100 days in the circle video. We offered someone $500,000 if they could live in a circle in a field for 100 days and instead of starting with his house in the circle that he would live in, we bring it in on a crane 30 seconds into the video. Why? Because who the fuck else on Youtube can do that lol. The fact that we lifted a house on a crane didn\u2019t add anything to the title and thumbnail. It obviously hooked the viewers and helped retention but there are millions of ways we could have done that easier.

On top of being the main talent I have to work with each channel to make sure the creatives are always evolving and not getting stale and in general be a visionary for them. Basically running 4 channels at a high level better then anyone else in the world can run one. We also have a Beast Burger and Feastables and I still have to set the vision and be the lead creative.

Let\u2019s take production for example. Let\u2019s say you are tasked with finding us a castle to live in for 50 hours and while doing research you find a castle and a number to call for the owner. So you do call, and he answers. Only problem is he says he quit the castle renting business to pursue his dream of building a 100 foot tall lego catapult. You can obviously tell where i\u2019m going with this. Ideally you\u2019d recognize that\u2019s badass as fuck and try to convince him to let us use it when we do find a castle. This is a bad example because it\u2019s so obvious but if you\u2019re doing your job right you will be doing an absurd amounts of calls and data collecting. While trying to complete your prios and prepare for the video you should always be on the lookout for new things you can bring to your creative team to inspire them.

You can see who can throw it the farthest with their left hand out of a group of 5 people. Watching them throw a baby doll with their bad hand and funny sound effects is fucken hilarious.

That\u2019s one of the secret weapons of MrBeast Productions, we aren't stuck in any old ways of thinking and you can literally turn anything into content.

Chris Tyson (our first subscriber and the guy in the videos) is a wonderful example of an information diet being used to perfection. The dude is funny as fuck. I\u2019ve never met anyone in my entire life that can make people laugh like he can and I never understood why he was so good at it until I lived with him for a few years. The dude watches an obscene amount of cartoons and stupid shit. His eyeballs exsist to inhail copious amounts of just goofy, dumb, and brain numbing content. And as a result he can quote almost any line from any episode of spongebob. He\u2019s able   to draw from so much stupid shit in his head as inspiration to make jokes and be quirky. As a result he is fucken hilarious. But let\u2019s imagine a different Chris, let\u2019s say instead of cartoons and stupid shit, his information diet was stocks and investing advice. And for 5 years that\u2019s all he consumed. Do you think he\u2019d be just as funny as he currently is? No. He in my opinion wouldn\u2019t even be 20% as funny. If you\u2019re a writer or director you really need to monitor and perfect your information diet. If your diet is not correct, you won\u2019t have a good pulse on culture. I don\u2019t want you to be a chris, in fact, I think that would probably do you harm. Talent needs to inhale cartoons so they can be funny, writers need to inhale inspiration. Let\u2019s say there is a purple fruit in the middle of Australia that when eaten makes you 2 feet taller. If it truly did exist, you wouldn\u2019t have known that until just right now. But now that you know of it, you can draw on it for inspiration for every piece of content you write going forward. That\u2019s beautiful, it can now sit in the back of your mind waiting for that one video where it is needed. It might take 10 videos or even 100 but eventually you\u2019ll be brainstorming a bit and think of the right one to use the fruit for. Apply this to everything on this fucken planet. You. Can\u2019t. Get. Inspired. By. Things. You. Don\u2019t. Know. Exist. So how do you learn more about what's out there in the world? How do you stay up to date on the latest memes? How do you know what\u2019s going on with celebrities? What\u2019s trending on youtube? What other creators are doing? What\u2019s popping on tik tok? Your information diet.
